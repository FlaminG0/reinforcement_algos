# Classic Reinforcement Algorithms
Classic Reinforcement Algorithms (CRA) is a collection of classic reinforcement learning algorithms implementation, mainly based on [this repository](https://github.com/boyu-ai/Hands-on-RL). The difference is this reposoitory used [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) (a maintained fork of OpenAIâ€™s Gym library) instead of Gym.


## Supported Algorithms


- DQN [(paper)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602)

- MADDPG [(paper)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02275)



## Installation

To install Gymnasium, use this:

```bash
  pip install gymnasium==0.28.1
```
Or check its [website](https://pypi.org/project/gymnasium/).
